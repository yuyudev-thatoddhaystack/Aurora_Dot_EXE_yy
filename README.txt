--Readme--

Hello! Thank you for downloading Aurora.EXE! She's an original character that, in her universe, is a virtual youtuber that shares an ukagaka of herself to her fans. She has a variety of utilitarian and entertainment functions, such as sleep reminders and games. 

Aurora has horror content in visuals and text, but it is off by default and can be toggled on in her config menu. Please note that her story will contain mild horror content in text regardless of the horror setting. Specific content warnings are at the bottom of this readme.
